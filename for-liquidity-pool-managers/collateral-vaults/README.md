# Collateral Vaults

Every pool has one vault for each of the accepted collateral types. Keeping the collateral in pools separated into vaults has the following implications:

* When a [liquidity position is liquidated](../../for-liquidity-integrators/liquidity-positions/position-liquidations.md), its collateral and debt is distributed pro-rata across the other liquidity positions of the same collateral type in the pool (i.e. of the other positions in the vault), not across all positions in the pool.
* Entire [vaults may be liquidated](vault-liquidations.md).
* Pool owners can attach [rewards distributors](../rewards-distributors.md) to vaults, allowing them to incentivize liquidity of particular types to be added to their pools.
