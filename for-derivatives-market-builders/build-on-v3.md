## Why build on v3

Synthetix v3 solves the cold-start and scaling liquidity problems for derivate protocols, with more than $500m of liquidity waiting for new markets. Synthetix is an endlessly composable and configurable liquidity layer; backing derivative Markets, so they can scale faster, and LPs can accrue more fees.

* Product:&#x20;
  * Cold-start liquidity: Synthetix Liquidity Providers can allocate their collateral to your Pool in a few clicks
  * Scaling liquidity: Incentivize your own Pool, or attract existing Pools to back your Market
* Technical:&#x20;
  * Speed: It's trivial to create and configure Pools/Markets/Rewards
  * Security: v3 has been audited by both Open Zeppelin and Iosiro

## Playbook for building on v3

1. **Create your Market:** Create a new derivatives Market, or adapt your existing product, following [market-development-guide.md](market-development-guide.md "mention"), and conforming to the `IMarket` interface in [integrating-synthetix.md](integrating-synthetix.md "mention")
2. **Register your Market:** Propose an [SCCP](https://docs.synthetix.io/dao/how-to-write-sip-sccps) to Synthetix governance for your Market to be registered _(this governance requirement goes away once permissionless Markets are enabled by Spartan Council)_
3. **Get collateral:** Request some of the existing $500m+ LP collateral in the Synthetix system for your Market
   1. request collateral from an existing Pool OR
   2. propose a new Pool of your own via [SCCP](https://docs.synthetix.io/dao/how-to-write-sip-sccps), and attract Synthetix LPs[creating-and-configuring-pools.md](../for-liquidity-pool-managers/creating-and-configuring-pools.md "mention") _(this governance requirement goes away once permissionless Pools are enabled by Spartan Council)_

Your high performing Market will be attractive to other Pools and Synthetix LPs.

## Use cases

* Want to create a novel derivatives product? You could create a v3 Market, then request one of the existing Pools to delegate your Market some collateral, or create a Pool.
* Want to control your own liquidity? You could propose to create a new Pool, and offer additional token incentives to Liquidity Providers with the Rewards Manager.&#x20;
