# Perps V3 Keepers

V3 perps markets rely on keepers to fetch offchain price data to fill orders and liquidate accounts. Sample code for both types of keepers can be found [here](https://github.com/Synthetixio/sample-v3-keeper). Follow the documentation for instructions on setting up and configuring the keeper.

{% hint style="info" %}
Keepers are open source and competitive, but it is recommended that integrators run their own keepers in case no community keepers are operating.
