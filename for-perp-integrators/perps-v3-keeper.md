# Perps V3 Keepers

V3 perps markets rely on keepers to fetch offchain price data to fill orders and liquidate accounts. Sample code for both types of keepers can be found [here](https://github.com/Synthetixio/sample-v3-keeper). Follow the documentation for instructions on setting up and configuring the keeper.
