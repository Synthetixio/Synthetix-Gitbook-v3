  Welcome to the Onchain Summer builder's guide for Synthetix. We've provided
  some extra resources to help builders on Base get started building on the
  Synthetix contracts.

# Onchain Summer



### _More Resources Coming Soon_



Most of the resources you need will already be available here in the Synthetix V3 Developers Docs. You can navigate to the relevant sections in the left-hand nav menu to explore more. For reference, Andromeda refers to the Synthetix V3 package on Base.&#x20;

### Builder Tracks

If you are interested in building an integration with Synthetix Perps, check out: [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")



If you are interested in building new derivatives markets on Synthetix, check out: [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")



If you are interested in building bots or scripts using the **Python SDK**, check out the [playground](https://github.com/Synthetixio/sdk-playground) or [read the docs](../for-perp-integrators/perps-python-sdk.md). Some ideas for builders interested in the Python SDK are:

* Execute trading strategies similar to the [funding rate arbitrage bot](https://github.com/50shadesofgwei/SynthetixFundingRateArbitrage). Consider simplified strategies like price triggers, or triggers based on market conditions.
* Automate functions around the contracts similar to the sample [liquidation or order keepers](https://github.com/Synthetixio/sample-v3-keeper).
* Build Telegram or Discord bots for tracking market conditions, traders, and market activity.
* Build a command line interface for the SDK, improving the user experience.



Sandboxes for Base are available here: [https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-deployments/tree/main/sandboxes](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-deployments/tree/main/sandboxes)



If you can't find what you need please join us in the [Synthetix discord server](https://discord.gg/synthetix) and ask your question in the #onchain-summer channel to talk with someone on our developer support team.&#x20;
