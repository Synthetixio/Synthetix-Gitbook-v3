6\.  You're now an LP and eligible for perps trading fees + USDC/SNX LP incentives

**Key Points to Understand:**

* Collateral determines your share of fees and incentives (different from V2's debt-based distribution)
* 24-hour lock applies to withdrawals for USDC, fees, new deposits, and other activities reset the timer
* LPs can only supply USDC to earn fees and incentives (no sUSD minting capability)
* Wrapped tokens may appear in your wallet or on Etherscan.
* Fee split: 40% to LPs, 40% to SNX buyback and burn, 20% to integrators.&#x20;
* Reference other blog posts for incentive program details and timelines.

**Risks of LPing:**

* ⚠️ Skew or poor market performance can increase debt
* ⚠️ Smart contract vulnerabilities
* ⚠️ Collateral depeg (USDC)

As always, do your own research and only deposit what you can afford to lose. Understanding the risks is crucial before participating as a liquidity provider.
